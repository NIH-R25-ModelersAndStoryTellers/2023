## Introduction

In this tutorial, we learn to:

* wrangle census data using the **tidyverse** ecosystem

This tutorial follow [Analyzing US Census Data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html) Chapter 3 and [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

## The tidyverse

- **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages for data ingestion, wrangling, and visualization.

- The lead developer Hadley Wickham won the 2019 _COPSS Presidents’ Award_ (the Nobel Prize of Statistics)

> for influential work in statistical computing, visualization, graphics, and data analysis; for developing and implementing an impressively comprehensive computational infrastructure for data analysis through R software; for making statistical thinking and computing accessible to large audience; and for enhancing an appreciation for the important role of statistics among data scientists.

- Install the tidyverse ecosystem by `install.packages("tidyverse")`. You don't need to install on the server since it's already installed there.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
```

- The [Posit cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) can be very helpful for locating specific commands.

## Exploring Census data with tidyverse tools

### Row operations: sorting and filtering

- Median age from the 2016-2020 ACS for all counties in the United States:
```{r}
median_age <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = "B01002_001",
  year = 2020
)

median_age
```

- Sort/arrange the rows by `estimate` (in increasing order):
```{r}
arrange(median_age, estimate)
```

- Sort/arrange the rows by `estimate` (in decreasing order):
```{r}
arrange(median_age, desc(estimate))
```

- Filter the data frame accrding to some condition(s). 
```{r}
filter(median_age, estimate >= 50)
```

### Column operations: separating and mutating

- Separate one column into two:
```{r}
separate(
  median_age,
  NAME,
  into = c("county", "state"),
  sep = ", "
)
```

- `summary_var` for normalizing. Compare the population of counties in California by race & Hispanic origin with their baseline populations, using data from the 2016-2020 ACS.
```{r}
race_vars <- c(
  White = "B03002_003",
  Black = "B03002_004",
  Native = "B03002_005",
  Asian = "B03002_006",
  HIPI = "B03002_007",
  Hispanic = "B03002_012"
)

ca_race <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  state = "CA",
  variables = race_vars,
  summary_var = "B03002_001",
  year = 2020
)

ca_race
```

- By using dplyr’s `mutate()` function, we calculate a new column, `percent`, representing the percentage of each county’s population that corresponds to each racial/ethnic group in 2016-2020. The `select()` function, also in dplyr, retains only those columns that we need to view.
```{r}
ca_race_percent <- ca_race %>%
  mutate(percent = 100 * (estimate / summary_est)) %>%
  select(NAME, variable, percent)

ca_race_percent
```

- The **pipe operator** `%>%` passes the result of a given line of code as the first argument of the code on the next line. 

### Group-wise operation: split-apply-combine

- Find the largest race/ethnicity group in each county in California:
```{r}
ca_race_percent %>%
  group_by(NAME) %>%
  filter(percent == max(percent))
```

- Find the median percentage of each race/ethnicity group in California:
```{r}
ca_race_percent %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  summarize(median_pct = median(percent))
```

- Household income data for California counties from the 2012-2016 ACS:
```{r}
ca_hh_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  table = "B19001",
  state = "CA",
  year = 2016
)

ca_hh_income
```

- Recode household income into groups: `below35k`, `bw35kand75k`, and `above75k`:
```{r}
ca_group_sums <- ca_hh_income %>%
  filter(variable != "B19001_001") %>%
  mutate(incgroup = case_when(
    variable < "B19001_008" ~ "below35k", 
    variable < "B19001_013" ~ "bw35kand75k", 
    TRUE ~ "above75k"
  )) %>%
  group_by(GEOID, incgroup) %>%
  summarize(estimate = sum(estimate))

ca_group_sums
```

## Comparing ACS estimats over time

- Change of geography name (e.g., county).

- Change of variable name.

## Handling margin of error in ACS
