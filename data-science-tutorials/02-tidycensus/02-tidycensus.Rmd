## Introduction

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/795c039ba2520455d833b4034befc8cf360a70ba/558a5/diagrams/data-science-explore.png)

In this tutorial, we learn core functions in the **tidycensus** package:

- `get_decennial()`: request data from the US Decennial Census APIs for 2000, 2010, and 2020.  

- `get_acs()`: request data from the 1-year and 5-year ACS samples. 1-year ACS back to 2005. 5-year ACS back to 2005-2009.

- `get_estimates()`: interface to the Population Estimates APIs, which include yearly estimates of population characteristics by state, county, and metropolitan area, along with components of change demographic estimates like births, deaths, and migration rates.

- `get_pums()`: interface to ACS Public Use Microdata Sample APIs, which include anonymized individual-level records from the ACS organized by household and are highly useful for many different social science analyses.

- `get_flows()`: interface to the ACS Migration Flows APIs, which include information on in- and out-flows from various geographies for the 5-year ACS samples, enabling origin-destination analyses.

Resources: [Analyzing US Census Data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html) Chapter 2 and [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

## Getting started with tidycensus

Sign up for a Census API key at <https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html> and install the key. You **don't** need to do this for this class.
```{r}
library(tidycensus)
# census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

## Decennial Census

**Exercise**. Display the documentation for the function `get_decennial()`.
```{r ex-get-decennial, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r ex-get-decennial-solution}
?get_decennial
```

- Get data on total population by state from the 2010 decennial Census:
```{r}
total_population_10 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",   # aggregate unit
  variables = "P001001", # total population
  year = 2010
)

total_population_10
```

**Exercise**. Obtain the county population counts by modifying the `geography` argument to `"county"`? How many counties are in the US? Any guess? Hint: `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions.
```{r county-pop-10, exercise = TRUE}
total_population_10 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",   # aggregate unit
  variables = "P001001", # total population
  year = 2010
)

total_population_10
```

```{r county-pop-10-solution}
pop_by_county <- get_decennial(
  geography = "county", 
  variables = "P001001", # total population
  year = 2010
)

pop_by_county
nrow(pop_by_county)
```


**Exercise**. Change `year` to `2020`. What's the output?
```{r total-pop-20, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r total-pop-20-solution}
# 2020 decennial census use "pl" summary file, with diff. variable names!
get_decennial(
  geography = "state",   # aggregate unit
  variables = "P1_005N", # total population
  year = 2020
)
```

- By default, `get_decennial()` uses the argument `sumfile = "sf1"`, which fetches data from the [decennial Census Summary File 1](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2010/dec/summary-file-1.html), which includes core demographic characteristics for Census geographies (2000 and 2010).

- 2020 Decennial Census data are available from the [PL 94-171 Redistricting summary file](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html), which is specified with `sumfile = "pl"` and is also available for 2010. These variables include total population and housing units; race and ethnicity; voting-age population; and group quarters population.

    For example, the code below retrieves information on the American Indian & Alaska Native (AIAN) population by state from the 2020 decennial Census.
```{r}
aian_2020 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",
  variables = "P1_005N",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "pl"
)

aian_2020
```

**Exercise** (advanced). Which states have the largest/smallest AIAN population? 
```{r ex-total-pop-20, exercise = TRUE}
aian_2020 <- get_decennial(
  geography = "state",
  variables = "P1_005N",
  year = 2020,
  sumfile = "pl"
)
```

## American Community Survey

**Exercise**. Display the documentation for the function `get_acs()`.
```{r ex-get-acs-doc, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r ex-get-decennial-doc-solution}
?get_acs
```

- The number of residents born in Mexico by state (5-year ACS, 2016-2010):
```{r}
born_in_mexico <- get_acs(
  geography = "state", 
  variables = "B05006_150",
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2020
)

born_in_mexico
```

**Exercise**. Change to year `2022`, what is the result?
```{r acs5-2020, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r acs5-2020-solution}
# 5-year ACS data is unavailable for 2022 yet so following code pops error
get_acs(
  geography = "state", 
  variables = "B05006_150", # number born in Mexico
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2022
)
```

- The number of residents born in Mexico by in LA County (1-year ACS, 2019):
```{r}
born_in_mexico_1yr <- get_acs(
  geography = "county", 
  county = "Los Angeles",
  state = "CA",
  variables = "B05006_150", # number born in Mexico
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2019
)

born_in_mexico_1yr
```

**Exercise**. Change to year `2020`, what is the result?  Change to year `2021`, what is the result? 
```{r acs1-2020, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r acs1-2020-solution}
# 2020 1-year ACS is not released because of COVID-19
```

## Geography and geographic subsets

- For a listing of the geographies in tidycensus, see this [table](https://walker-data.com/census-r/an-introduction-to-tidycensus.html#geography-and-variables-in-tidycensus).

- Median household income by county in California from the 2015-2020 ACS:
```{r}
ca_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "county", 
  state = "CA",
  variables = "B19013_001", # median household income
  year = 2020 # default: survey = "acs5"
)

ca_income
```

**Exercise**. What is the median household income of the state of California (hint: change argument `geography` to `"state"`? What is the median household income of the Los Angeles County (hint: set argument `county` to `Los Angeles`? 
```{r median-household-income-lac-2020, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r median-household-income-lac-2020-solution}
# median household income of California
get_acs(
  geography = "state", 
  state = "CA",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  year = 2020
)

# median household income of LA County
get_acs(
  geography = "county", 
  state = "CA",
  county = "Los Angeles",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  year = 2020
)
```

**Exercise**. Find the county-level median household income for the State you live in or a state of research interest. 
```{r median-household-income-2020, exercise = TRUE}

```

- Median household income by census tract in Los Angeles County of California:
```{r}
lacounty_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract", 
  state = "CA",
  county = "Los Angeles",
  variables = "B19013_001", 
  year = 2020
)

lacounty_income
```

## Variable dictionary

- How the hell do I know all those variable codes? Are all variable codes same across years and across decennial census and ACS? Answer: `load_variables()`.

**Exercise**. Display the documentation for the function `load_variables()`.
```{r load-variables-doc, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r load-variables-doc-solution}
?load_variables
```

- All variables in the 2016 1-year ACS:
```{r}
v16 <- load_variables(2016, "acs1", cache = TRUE)

v16
```

- Variables starting with `B19001`:
```{r}
filter(v16, str_detect(name, "B19001"))
```

- Household income groups by state for the 2016 1-year ACS (long format by default, `output = "tidy"`).
```{r}
get_acs(
  geography = "state", 
  table = "B19001", 
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2016
)
```

- Household income groups by state for the 2016 1-year ACS (wide format, `output = "tidy"`.
```{r}
get_acs(
  geography = "state", 
  table = "B19001", 
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2016,
  output = "wide"
)
```

### Rename variables

- Return the desired names rather than the Census variable IDs:
```{r}
get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  state = "CA",
  variables = c(
    medinc = "B19013_001",
    medage = "B01002_001"
    ),
  year = 2020
)
```

**Exercise**. Return the same result in the wide format. 
```{r ex-median-household-income-2020, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r ex-median-household-income-2020-solution}
get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  state = "CA",
  variables = c(
    medinc = "B19013_001",
    medage = "B01002_001"
    ),
  year = 2020,
  output = "wide"
)
```

## Understand GEOIDs

- Households by Census block from the 2020 Census in Los Angeles County, California.
```{r}
get_decennial(
  geography = "block",
  county = "Los Angeles",
  state = "CA",
  variables = "H1_001N", # number of households
  year = 2020
)
```

- GEOID format:
    - Digits 1-2: [Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html) for the state.  
    - Digits 3-5: County.  
    - Digits 6-11: Census tract.  
    - Digit 12: Block group.  
    - Digits 13-15: Census block.  

## Using `get_estimates()`

- [Population Estimates Program (PEP)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html) provides yearly estimates of the US population and its components between decennial Censuses.

- The products available include "population", "components", "housing", and "characteristics".
```{r}
get_estimates(
  geography = "county",
  product = "components",
  state = "CA",
  county = "Los Angeles",
  year = 2019
)
```

- Break down `characteristics` by `AGEGROUP`, `RACE`, `SEX`, or `HISP`.
```{r}
get_estimates(
  geography = "state",
  product = "characteristics",
  breakdown = c("SEX", "HISP"),
  breakdown_labels = TRUE,
  state = "CA",
  year = 2019
)
```

## Using `get_flows()`

- The ACS Migration Flows API returns information on both in- and out-migration for states, counties, and metropolitan areas.

    Flows in and out of LA County.
```{r}
get_flows(
  geography = "county",
  county = "Los Angeles",
  state = "CA",
  year = 2020 # end year of 5-year ACS
)
```
